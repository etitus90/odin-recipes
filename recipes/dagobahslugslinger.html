        <p>"As you probably guessed from its name, this particular cocktail derives its inimitable herbal nip from the sticky slime of the Dagobah swamp slug - or, at least, from the subtitute <a href="./dagobahslugsyrup.html">Dagobah Slug Syrup</a> on this site's first batch of recipes. Despite its decidedly floral notes, the Dagobah Slug Slinger isn't nearly as swampy as you might expect from a drink that originated on Dagobah. That's because it's got a tart citrus base that provides the ideal balance to the slug's sweet, herbaceous ooze. The strong flavors do a nice job of smoothin' out the equally strong portion of booze it contains. But don't be fooled - this one has more kick to it than a master of Ter&#228;s K&#228;si!"</p>
